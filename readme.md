##Getting Started:
The purpose of this application is to allow users to organize and display their meetings in a single news feed. Users must login with their Google accounts. They may click the 'New Event' page in the top left to render an new event form. After each entry the event is displayed on the main page. Additionally, users may delete events and also learn about pandas on the main page.
